# WwiseAudioProject
WwiseAudioProject, for "Audio" Subject in Videogames Design and Development Degree of CITM, UPC (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya), with the teacher David Font ([@synchrnzr](https://github.com/synchrnzr)).

The Project consists on putting sounds and music to a game done by Wwise, whom audio was deleted. 

Project Done by: Andrés Saladrigas ([@TheArzhel](https://github.com/TheArzhel)), Adrián Font ([@AdrianFR99](https://github.com/AdrianFR99)), Joan Marín ([@X0KA](https://github.com/X0KA)), Roger León ([@rleonborras](https://github.com/rleonborras)) and Lucho Suaya ([@lucho1](https://github.com/lucho1)).


**Note:** Roger has no commits since he had LOTS of problems when opening the project in Unity (we tried a lot of things), but he did the same work than everyone by guiding us on how to do certaing things we didn't knew which he investigated or already knew (specially in exercises 2, 3 and 5) - you will check that in co-authors at some commits-.
